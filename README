**Running GEOAPT Spatial Data Browser
  At present, GeoApt runs as a Python script. There are no binary applications
  (.exe or .app) for Windows or Mac.

  * Linux or Mac OS X
    Use the run.sh script and specify the path to your QGIS installation.
    Running the script with no arguments will give you a hint.

  * Windows
    On Windows you must have the OSGeo4w install of QGIS. To run the browser
      1. From the Start menu, open an OSGeo4w shell
      2. Set the environment by issuing the following commands
          set PATH=%PATH%;c:\osgeo4w\apps\qgis-unstable\bin
          set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;c:\osgeo4w\apps\qgis-unstable\python
          set QGISHOME=c:\osgeo4w\apps\qgis-unstable        
    These settings assume your OSGeo4w install uses the default location. If
    not, adjust accordingly.
